# SmartBathroom
Course project for a smart bathroom web page that receives inputs from sensors and shows their readings in real-time. After the bathroom is used, it will perform an automatic cleaning of itself with the use of servomotors and sprinklers.

These sensors are real arduino modules on a raspberry pi and an esp8266, but also simulated ones using Cisco Packet Tracer.
